> Please note: Wendy understands that sometimes the state of the economy can make life difficult for people, and sometimes difficult choices have to be made. However, your mental, spiritual and physical well-being are a priority. Arrangements are available for clients who may need to pay over time.

### Appointment Cancellation Policy



To provide her clients with the maximum benefit possible, Wendy reserves appointment times exclusively for that person; If a client does not show up for an appointment, she cannot schedule someone else without a minimum of 24 hours notice.

If you cannot make your scheduled appointment, you may call and leave a message at the office at any time to cancel.

"No Shows" or appointments cancelled without 24 hours notice will result in a charge:

* Appointments of less than a half hour will result in a charge of $50.00 (fifty) dollars.
* Appointments scheduled for a half hour or more will be charged the amount of the appointment.
