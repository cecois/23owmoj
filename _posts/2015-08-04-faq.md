My goal is to make our time together as beneficial as possible. One way to do that is to be efficient; I don"t want you to feel that we are wasting any time going over basic information when we first meet. So I ask you to speak with my assistant first so she can gather things like past medical history, a list of any medications you are taking, details of past surgeries, and any relevant psychosocial information. If this is done before you and I get together, I can review the information and spend our time together focusing on the reason you are here.

In other practices you may spend the entire first meeting discussing basic information without ever getting to the issues. I want to use our time together for your benefit.

You ask all clients to do an initial telephone intake? Why is that?
](index.html#collapseOne)

[
Do I need to prepare or bring anything when we meet?
](index.html#collapseTwo)
No, you don"t have to bring anything, unless you did not tell my assistant about any medications or supplements you are taking. All medication information is important.
[
Can I bring someone with me when I see you?
](index.html#collapseThree)
Yes
[
Can I record our session?
](index.html#collapseFour)
Yes.
[
What can I expect from you?
](index.html#collapseFive)
All of my clients receive a comprehensive plan stating what you should do to get healthier and happier. You may also receive specific referrals to other professionals; I have a large number of contacts in both traditional and alternative health fields.
[
How many sessions does it take for me to feel better?
](index.html#collapseSix)
It"s hard to say. Each person is an individual with specific issues and healing abilities. An injury that takes someone else a long time to heal may only take you a short time.

### Medical Intuitive Body Scans

[
What are your Medical Intuitive Body Scans like?
](index.html#collapseSeven)
My goal is to make our time together as beneficial as possible. One way to do that is to be efficient; I don"t want you to feel that we are wasting any time going over basic information when we first meet. So I ask you to speak with my assistant first so she can gather things like past medical history, a list of any medicationThe initial body scan meeting takes about 90 minutes. I will briefly review the information on the intake form that you filled out with my assistant, and discuss things that may need clarification. Then I will then ask you to prioritize your concerns, so we can address those items that are important to you first.

I will then do a comprehensive scan of your entire body and provide you with information that I receive from it; this information might be both general and specific regarding the state of your health. There is never any need to disrobe.

During the body scan process you can ask me any question as we go along. At the end of the session we develop a personalized health plan for you which may include additional services with me, another provider, traditional medical care, or other treatment options. You are always welcome to email me with questions, and every person who completes a Medical Intuitive Body Scan receives a free 15 minute follow-up. This is to allow you the chance to discuss any questions that may have come up after we meet.

If you wish to continue to work with me, I base my time on 15 minute increments (see [Fee Schedule](index.html#fees) for fees).
[
What do you "see" when you scan a client?
](index.html#collapseEight)
Imagine you are looking at a movie of a working body; you will see the organs, the blood flow, the nervous system, muscles and other body structures. Not only do I see the exact same thing, I also see diseases, pain, and illness; in fact, I even see in color.

I see cancer as fingers around the tumor site, and when it"s moving I see the motion. Recently I scanned a client who had severe headaches. When I looked at him I saw the nerves in his neck as neon lights, and I could see the cervical discs in his neck were misaligned and the disc pads were swollen. The very next day he saw his chiropractor, had some x-rays taken, and discovered he had pinched nerves in his neck that were causing his headaches, caused by the misaligned discs.

When I do a body scan and see a problem with someone, it is obvious to me that something is amiss. However, we have to remember that what I am seeing is a snapshot in time of that moment only, not in the past. Together we then have to figure out how the condition came to pass. It could be congenital, or caused by disease, an accident, a bad fall, or a number of other reasons.
[
How often do you require a Medical Intuitive Body Scan to be done?
](index.html#collapseNine)
Once I conduct the initial body scan, any contact with me within the year does not require a new scan, unless the person has experienced an event that may change their medical status (such as a car accident). However, if someone comes back to me after a year has gone by since the first scan and we have not had any contact, a new full body scan is needed, due to the ever-changing physical conditions of the body.
[
Do we have to be together for you to do a body scan? What if I am sick or traveling and I can"t be there?
](index.html#collapseTen)
We don"t have to be in the same room together. I work with people all across the globe as well as locally. We can either use a telephone or Skype.
[
Once I start treatment with you, should I stop seeing my regular doctor?
](index.html#collapseEleven)
No, please continue to see any doctor that you are currently seeing. Additionally, if you are seeing a doctor for a condition, any advice I give you should be reviewed by your doctor. We have to remember that sometimes it takes a team approach to help someone get better. I want to work with your physician, and I am happy to contact and discuss treatment with your doctor.

### Integrative Psychotherapy
[
Please describe your Integrative Psychotherapy approach.
](index.html#collapseFourteen)
Integrative Psychotherapy creates an interactive decision-making process for all aspects of a person's wellness. I provide this approach for the benefit of mind, body and spirit. I believe that "we"re not just a head," so my sessions take into consideration a psychological, spiritual and physical solution.

I am traditionally trained as a therapist, so my confidentiality requirements are the same as any other psychotherapist.
[
I am physically fit, but I am depressed and anxious all the time. Can you help me?
](index.html#collapseFifteen)
Yes, I work with mood disorders all the time. Because the relationship between the systems in the human body is so integrated, a full body scan may be appropriate to rule out underlying physical issues. You may also want to review the other services I offer for your condition.

### Energy Healing

![](img/jumbo1.png)
[
What is energy healing?
](index.html#collapseSixteen)
All living things have their own energy. And yet, sometimes this energy gets "stuck" and needs to be released gently in order to bring the body back into balance. My energy healing is done on a table; we start with a gentle meditation and I use a light touch to balance the energy and achieve flow throughout the body. There is never any pain or pressure.

My experience covers acupressure, Reiki, craniosacral and massage therapy; my treatments are a distillation of all of those.

### Soul Retrieval

[
Can you describe Soul Retrieval?
](index.html#collapseSeventeen)
Our lives are filled with so many types of events. Some of these are traumatic, and parts of ourselves are loss through this trauma, in this or other lifetimes.

In order to retrieve those parts and integrate them back into ourselves, I use Soul Retrieval to assist in the healing process and regenerate parts of us that are missing or damaged. I am also comfortable working with entities or spiritual issues that need resolution.

### Shamanic Studies

![](img/jumbo1.png)
[
What is your Shamanic Studies program?
](index.html#collapseEighteen)
This is a one-on-one program for those with a sincere interest in the understanding and practice of Shamanic Healing. It"s for people who want to find their higher path and learn how to best do so.

This program will allow you to find your unique spiritual path that feels best for you. Because I only accept very few individuals for this program, a phone discussion before we meet is required for prequalification.
