One way to do that is to be efficient; I don"t want you to feel that we are wasting any time going over basic information when we first meet.

One way to do that is to be efficient; I don"t want you to feel that we are wasting any time going over basic information when we first meet. So I ask you to speak with my assistant first so she can gather things like past medical history, a list of any medicationThe initial body scan meeting takes about 90 minutes.  I will briefly review the information on the intake form that you filled out with my assistant, and discuss things that may need clarification. Then I will then ask you to prioritize your concerns, so we can address those items that are important to you first.</p>



                                      <p>I will then do a comprehensive scan of your entire body and provide you with information that I receive from it; this information might be both general and specific regarding the state of your health. There is never any need to disrobe.</p>



                                      <p>During the body scan process you can ask me any question as we go along. At the end of the session we develop a personalized health plan for you which may include additional services with me, another provider, traditional medical care, or other treatment options.  You are always welcome to email me with questions, and every person who completes a Medical Intuitive Body Scan receives a free 15 minute follow-up. This is to allow you the chance to discuss any questions that may have come up after we meet.</p>

                                      <p>If you wish to continue to work with me, I base my time on 15 minute increments (see <a href="index.html#fees" aria-controls="fees" role="tab" data-toggle="tab" onclick="$('html,body').animate({scrollTop:0},'slow');">Fee Schedule</a> for fees).</p>

Not only do I see the exact same thing, I also see diseases, pain, and illness; in fact, I even see in color.</p>



                                      <p>I see cancer as fingers around the tumor site, and when it"s moving I see the motion.  Recently I scanned a client who had severe headaches. When I looked at him I saw the nerves in his neck as neon lights, and I could see the cervical discs in his neck were misaligned and the disc pads were swollen. The very next day he saw his chiropractor, had some x-rays taken, and discovered he had pinched nerves in his neck that were causing his headaches, caused by the misaligned discs.</p>

                                      <p>When I do a body scan and see a problem with someone, it is obvious to me that something is amiss. However, we have to remember that what I am seeing is a snapshot in time of that moment only, not in the past. Together we then have to figure out how the condition came to pass.  It could be congenital, or caused by disease, an accident, a bad fall, or a number of other reasons.</p>

                                    <p>Integrative Psychotherapy creates an interactive decision-making process for all aspects of a person's wellness.  I provide this approach for the benefit of mind, body and spirit. I believe that "we"re not just a head," so my sessions take into consideration a psychological, spiritual and physical solution.</p>



                                    <p>I am traditionally trained as a therapist, so my confidentiality requirements are the same as any other psychotherapist. </p>

                              <p>All living things have their own energy. And yet, sometimes this energy gets "stuck" and needs to be released gently in order to bring the body back into balance. My energy healing is done on a table; we start with a gentle meditation and I use a light touch to balance the energy and achieve flow throughout the body. There is never any pain or pressure.</p>



                              <p>My experience covers acupressure, Reiki, craniosacral and massage therapy; my treatments are a distillation of all of those.</p>
