                        <p>Wendy can intuitively see into your body, much like a CT scan, to identify and address physical health concerns including chronic conditions often undiagnosed by conventional methods. This is a ninety minute session of viewing and assessing health concerns and strengths including a head-to-toe mental scan of your body.</p>

                        <p>Wendy provides energy healing sessions, drawing from the disciplines of Reiki, energy balancing, personal totem pole process, craniosacral, accupressure and zero balancing. She will often use guided imagery to help improve the energy flow, or chi, creating wellness and an improved sense of well-being.  Areas of tension and chakras that hold energy are released, and energy flow is improved. </p>
